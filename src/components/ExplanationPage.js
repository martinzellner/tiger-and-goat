                Bagh Chal, which means "Moving Tigers," is a strategic board game originating from Nepal. It is a game of hunting played between two players on a grid of 5Ã—5 points. One player controls four tigers, and the other player controls up to 20 goats. The goal of the tigers is to capture five goats, while the goats aim to trap all four tigers so they cannot move.

                <li>Tigers can move to adjacent points along the lines or capture goats by jumping over them.</li>
                <li>Goats can only move to adjacent points along the lines once all 20 goats are placed.</li>
